# 💊 Meds Reminder Bot

# 🔒 Disclaimer

This project is a proof of concept and not a medical device. It should not be used as a substitute for medical advice or for life-critical medication reminders. Always follow professional healthcare guidance.

## 🚀 Overview  
**Meds Reminder Bot** is a Discord bot that pings you when it’s time to take your meds — but not in a boring “please take 20mg now” way.

You choose:
- what the reminder is for,
- when you want to be pinged,
- and which “voice” should yell at you.

At the scheduled time, the bot DMs you in-character.  
Examples:
- `Gotham needs you. Take your Adderall so you can focus and stop Joker before 9AM.` (Batman voice)
- `Hydrate, you goblin. Drink water right now.` (Gremlin best friend voice)
- `Proud of you. Take your anxiety meds and go be brilliant.` (Soft supportive voice)

This project is built for real brains in chaos: ADHD, Autism, PTSD, Anxiety, & Depression = executive dysfunction, 47 open tasks, and zero working memory. 

It’s not a medical device. It’s: 
    A reminder + do it in a way that gives me a hit of Dopamine = the version of me that actually remembers to take my meds.


## ✨ Key Features
- 🕒 **Custom Reminders by Time:** Set one or more reminders (08:00, 14:00, etc.) for any med / habit / routine.
- 🎭 **Persona-Based Messaging:** Pick the “voice” your reminder arrives in (e.g. Batman, drill sergeant, tender best friend). The bot uses that persona when it DMs you.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage:** Your reminders and persona choices are stored in a NoSQL database (DynamoDB locally, easily portable to Firestore on Google Cloud).
- ✅ **Acknowledge / Taken Flow (optional):** You can reply to confirm you took it, so you can keep yourself honest.
- 📜 **Last Taken Memory:** The bot can keep lightweight state like “last taken at 08:05” so you don’t double-dose.
- 🔐 **Private by Default:** Reminders arrive in DMs. This is built for you, not for an employer, parent, or caregiver.
- 🧩 **Extensible for AI:** The persona lines can be static or generated. The design supports plugging in an LLM later so Batman doesn’t repeat himself forever.


## Requirements

- discord
- configparser==5.0.2
- requests==2.26.0
- transformers==4.16.2
- logging
- boto3

## 🧠 Architecture
**Tech Stack**
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Discord SDK:** `discord.py` for commands and DMs
- **Scheduler:** Internal job scheduler triggers reminders at the right local time
- **Database:** NoSQL document-style storage for each user’s reminders
    - Default: local DynamoDB
    - Google Cloud option: Firestore (1 doc per user, with an array of reminders)
- **AI / Persona Text (Optional):** `transformers` for generating message text in a given “voice”
- **Secrets / Config:** `.env` + `python-dotenv`
- **Logging:** Python `logging`

**High-Level Flow:**
```text
User → "!r" → bot stores reminder {time, label, persona} in DB
Scheduler wakes up at that time
↓
Bot DMs the user in that persona’s voice
↓
User can respond "taken" to mark it
```

Example reminder object (conceptual):
{
    "discord_user_id": "1234567890",
    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "reminders": [
        {
            "label": "Adderall",
            "time": "08:00",
            "persona": "batman",
            "active": true,
            "lastTakenIso": "2025-10-25T12:05:00Z"
        }
    ]
}

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- 🔊 Dynamic persona text generation so you don’t get the same line every morning.
